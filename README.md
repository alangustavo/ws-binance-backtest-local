# WebSocket Simulator for Binance Historical Data

This project provides a WebSocket service that simulates Binance's WebSocket behavior using historical data. It's designed to be a robust platform for testing algorithms and automated trading strategies with trading bots.

## Key Features

- **WebSocket Simulation**: Emulates real-time data flow using accurate historical data from Binance.
- **Detailed Historical Data**: Access to a wide range of historical data for detailed and realistic simulations.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Adjust parameters like transmission speed and data volume to simulate various market conditions.
- **Integration Interface**: Simple, documented API for easy integration with automated trading bots.

## Project Objectives

- **Strategy Testing**: Enable developers and traders to experiment with and optimize trading strategies risk-free.
- **Algorithm Validation**: Validate trading algorithms in a simulated environment that mirrors real market behavior.
- **Education and Research**: Serve as an educational tool to understand market dynamics and explore new trading approaches.

## Getting Started
